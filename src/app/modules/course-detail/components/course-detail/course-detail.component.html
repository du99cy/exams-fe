    <h2>Mô tả</h2>
    <p>
      You can launch a new career in web development today by learning HTML &
      CSS. You don't need a computer science degree or expensive software. All
      you need is a computer, a bit of time, a lot of determination, and a
      teacher you trust. I've taught HTML and CSS to countless coworkers and
      held training sessions for fortune 100 companies. I am that teacher you
      can trust. Don't limit yourself by creating websites with some cheesy
      “site-builder" tool. This course teaches you how to take 100% control over
      your webpages by using the same concepts that every professional website
      is created with. This course does not assume any prior experience. We
      start at square one and learn together bit by bit. By the end of the
      course you will have created (by hand) a website that looks great on
      phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops alike. In the summer of 2020 the
      course has received a new section where we push our website live up onto
      the web using the free GitHub Pages service; this means you'll be able to
      share a link to what you've created with your friends, family, colleagues
      and the world! I have helped over 100,000 students and have received the
      following feedback: “…A fantastic course… clear, definite and engaging."
      “…Presentation is concise without being tedious… you honestly feel that
      you have a thorough understanding of the subject." “…[Brad] explained the
      process. Not memorize this or that, he explained the process. If you're
      looking to take a course to understand the foundations of creating
      websites, look no further." “Brad definitely has some of the best
      techniques to embed the lesson into your mind… hands down these are the
      best tutorials I have had the opportunity to view." “I found this course
      really helpful and I highly recommend it… all things you learn are seen in
      action instantly." “Brad has put together a great foundation for any body
      wishing to get a good understanding with front end web-development." “…I
      would definitely recommend this course to most folks I know who want to
      learn web design."
